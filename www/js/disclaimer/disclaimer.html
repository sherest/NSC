        <p>Our Terms of Use specifically incorporate the following End User License Agreement which grants you a
            revocable license to the Emergency Medical Response – Quick Reference Guide app.</p>

        <h1>End User License Agreement</h1>
        <p>Whenever you download or use an NSC application this NSC App End User License Agreement (“License”) applies
            to you. This License also incorporates by reference the NSC Terms of Service (“Terms”) and governs your use
            of the NSC application and related user documentation (the “App”). By downloading and/or using the App, you
            are agreeing to this License. If you don’t agree with any of these terms, you cannot download or use our
            Apps.</p>
        <p><b>1. Changes to this License</b></p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change all or part of this License at any time. IF YOU CONTINUE TO USE THIS APP AFTER
            WE
            POST CHANGED TERMS, THAT USE WILL CONSTITUTE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGED TERMS.</p>
        <p><b>2. Changes to the Apps, Services and/or Fees</b></p>
        <p>We may change or discontinue an App (and/or our website and any of our other services) without notice or
            liability to you. We may decide to charge (or charge more) for an App and/or services that integrate with an
            App.</p>
        <p><b>3. Grant of License</b></p>
        <p>Subject to the restrictions of this License, NSC grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited
            license to download, install and use in object code form a single copy of the App on each of your devices
            (e.g., your mobile phone, tablet, computer). Any attempt to use the App other than as permitted by this
            License will immediately terminate the license. Except for the rights explicitly granted in this License,
            NSC retains all right, title and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in the App, including
            the copies of the App on your devices. NSC may use third-party software that is subject to open source
            and/or third-party license terms. You are subject to those terms.</p>
        <p><b>4. License Restrictions</b></p>
        <p>You may not:
        <ul>
            <li>rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, loan, or otherwise transfer the App, your copy of the App or any
                of
                your rights and obligations under this License;
            </li>
            <li>remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings on the App;</li>
            <li>reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify or adapt the App, merge the App into another program,
                or
                create derivative works of the App;
            </li>
            <li>copy or distribute the App;</li>
            <li>use the App in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with this
                License.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may print copies of any user documentation provided in online or electronic form for your personal
            use.</p>
        <p><b>5. Termination</b></p>
        <p>This License will terminate automatically upon the earlier of: (a) your failure to comply with any terms of
            this License (whether or not we inform you of this termination); (b) you deleting the App(s) from your
            device(s); and (c) if you are using the App(s) in connection with a paid service, the end of the time period
            specified at time of purchase. In addition, NSC may terminate this License at any time, for any reason or no
            reason. If this License terminates, you must stop using the App(s) and delete them from your devices.</p>
        <p><b>6. Compliance</b></p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and your own contractual
            obligations to third parties.</p>
        <p><b>7. Privacy Policy</b></p>
        <p>If you download and/or use an NSC App, you are subject to our Privacy Policy. The current Privacy Policy may
            be viewed on <a href="http://nsc.org" target='_system'>nsc.org</a></p>
        <p><b>8. Transmission of Data/Updates</b></p>
        <p>Use of an App may involve the transmission of data over the Internet to NSC and to and from third parties.
            For the sake of copy protection, a valid activation might be verified automatically by the App from time to
            time. If you elect to receive automatic updates, we will push updates to your devices in keeping with the
            policies of Google Play and the App Store.</p>
