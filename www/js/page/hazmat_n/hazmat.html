        <ol>
            <li>Approach cautiously from upwind, uphill, or upstream. Stay clear of vapor, fumes, smoke and spills. Keep
                vehicle a safe distance away.
            </li>
            <li>Secure the scene. Isolate the area and protect yourself and others.</li>
            <li>Identify hazards. Look for placards, container labels, shipping documents, etc. Consult a Rail Car and
                Road
                Trailer Identification Chart, Safety Data Sheets, and people on the scene.
            </li>
            <li>Assess situation. Consider:
                <ul>
                    <li>Is there a fire, a spill, or a leak?</li>
                    <li>What are the weather conditions?</li>
                    <li>What is the terrain like?</li>
                    <li>Who/what is at risk: people, property, or the environment?</li>
                    <li>What actions should be taken: evacuation, shelter in-place, or dike? &nbsp;</li>
                    <li>What resources (human and equipment) are required?</li>
                    <li>What can be done immediately?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Obtain help. Contact dispatch to notify responsible agencies and call for assistance from qualified
                personnel.
            </li>
            <li>Respond in an appropriate manner:
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter area only when wearing appropriate protective gear.</li>
                    <li>Rescue attempts and protecting property must be weighed against you becoming part of the
                        problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>Establish command post and lines of communication.</li>
                    <li>Continually reassess the situation and modify the response accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Consider safety of people in the immediate area first, including your own.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Above all:</h1>
        <p>Do not assume that gases or vapors are harmless because of lack of a smell &ndash; odorless gases
            or vapors may be harmful. <strong>Use caution</strong> when handling empty containers because they may still present hazards until they are
            cleaned and purged of all residues.</p>
