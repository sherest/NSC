        <h1>Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Perform the standard assessment.</li>
            <li>In addition, ask caretakers about circumstances with questions such as these:
                <ul>
                    <li>When was the infant put to bed? When was he or she last seen?</li>
                    <li>What position was the infant in when found?</li>
                    <li>How did the infant look when found?</li>
                    <li>Was there anything unusual in the environment?</li>
                    <li>What has been the infant&rsquo;s general health recently?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Emergency Care for SUID</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Take body substance isolation precautions.</li>
            <li>Try to resuscitate the infant unless the body is cold and stiff (follow local protocol). Assure caretakers
                everything possible is being done, but do not offer false hope.
            </li>
            <li>Parts of infant in contact with the bed may look bruised (lividity, caused by blood pooling after death)&mdash;not
                a sign of abuse.
            </li>
            <li>While awaiting additional EMS resources, comfort, calm, and reassure caretakers, who are likely experiencing
                emotional distress, remorse, and guilt. If available, another responder should assist caretakers and explain
                what is being done.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid any comments that might suggest blame. Assure caretakers that there is nothing they could have done to
                prevent the death.
            </li>
