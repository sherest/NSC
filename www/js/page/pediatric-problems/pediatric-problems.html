        <h1>Pediatric Problems</h1>
        <h1>Blow-By Oxygen for Respiratory Distress</h1>
        <p>If a responsive infant or child resists a face mask:&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect high-flow oxygen to the mask and start the flow.</li>
            <li>Have the caretaker hold mask about 2 inches from the infant&rsquo;s or child&rsquo;s face.</li>
            <li>If the child is still agitated by the mask, try connecting oxygen tubing to a hole punched in the bottom of a
                paper cup, and hold it near the child&rsquo;s mouth.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Seizures </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Potentially life threatening.</li>
            <li>You do not need to know cause.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Emergency Care for Seizures</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Place the patient on the floor and protect from the environment.</li>
            <li>Loosen constricting clothing. Remove eyeglasses.</li>
            <li>Ask bystanders (except caretakers) to leave the area.</li>
            <li>Assure that the airway remains open.</li>
            <li>Never attempt to restrain the patient.</li>
            <li>Do not put anything in the patient&rsquo;s mouth.</li>
            <li>If the patient is bluish, ensure the airway is open and give ventilations.</li>
            <li>After a seizure, place an unresponsive patient in the recovery position.</li>
            <li>Seizure patients often have significant oral secretions; be prepared to suction the airway.</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
            <li>Report assessment findings to additional EMS personnel.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Perform the standard assessment.</li>
            <li>In addition, ask caretakers about circumstances with questions such as these:
                <ul>
                    <li>When was the infant put to bed? When was he or she last seen?</li>
                    <li>What position was the infant in when found?</li>
                    <li>How did the infant look when found?</li>
                    <li>Was there anything unusual in the environment?</li>
                    <li>What has been the infant&rsquo;s general health recently?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h1>Emergency Care for SUID</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Take body substance isolation precautions.</li>
            <li>Try to resuscitate the infant unless the body is cold and stiff (follow local protocol). Assure caretakers
                everything possible is being done, but do not offer false hope.
            </li>
            <li>Parts of infant in contact with the bed may look bruised (lividity, caused by blood pooling after death)&mdash;not
                a sign of abuse.
            </li>
            <li>While awaiting additional EMS resources, comfort, calm, and reassure caretakers, who are likely experiencing
                emotional distress, remorse, and guilt. If available, another responder should assist caretakers and explain
                what is being done.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid any comments that might suggest blame. Assure caretakers that there is nothing they could have done to
                prevent the death.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Emergency Care for Trauma </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>In all trauma patients, use the jaw thrust to open the airway. Use the head tilt&ndash;chin lift if you
                cannot successfully open the airway with the jaw thrust.
            </li>
            <li>Suction the airway as needed.</li>
            <li>Manually stabilize the head and neck.</li>
            <li>Manually stabilize extremity injuries.</li>
            <li>Treat for shock by elevating legs, if spinal injury is not suspected, and maintaining body temperature.</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
            <li>Ensure transport as soon as possible.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Emergency Care When Abuse Is Suspected</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Do not accuse caretakers in the field. It is not your role to accuse a caretaker, and accusation and
                confrontation may delay treatment and/or transport of the patient.
            </li>
            <li>Treat the patient&rsquo;s injuries appropriately.</li>
            <li>Protect the child from further abuse, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Report objective information to the responding EMS unit.</li>
            <li>Save any evidence of physical or sexual abuse.</li>
            <li>File a report as required by state law and local protocol:
                <ul>
                    <li>Remain objective.</li>
                    <li>Report what you see and what you hear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Do not comment on what you think.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Maintain confidentiality about the call.</li>
        </ol>
