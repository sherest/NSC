        <ul>
            <li>For a patient who is breathing and has a pulse or capillary refill time
                under 2 seconds, assess mental status by giving the patient a simple
                command: &ldquo;Open your eyes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Squeeze my
                hand.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Patients who follow your command are considered alert and responsive and
                are tagged Priority 2 (yellow tag).
            </li>
            <li>Patients who cannot follow a simple command are considered unresponsive
                and are tagged Priority 1 (red tag).
            </li>
