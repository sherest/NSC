        <h1>Step 1. Assess Breathing</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Check whether the child is breathing.</li>
            <li>If the child is breathing at rate of 15&ndash;45 breaths/minute, move on
                to assess circulation.
            </li>
            <li>If the child is breathing slower than 15 or faster than 45
                breaths/minute, or if breathing is irregular, tag the child Priority 1
                (red tag).
            </li>
            <li>If the child is not breathing, open the airway.</li>
            <li>If still not breathing, look in the mouth for a foreign body and remove
                it if &nbsp;seen.
            </li>
            <li>If the child is now breathing, tag child Priority 1 (red tag).</li>
            <li>If not breathing, check for a pulse.</li>
            <li>If no pulse, tag the child Priority 4 (black tag).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Give a child with a pulse 5 ventilations; if the child begins breathing,
                tag the child red and move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>If the child does not begin breathing, tag the child black.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Step 2. Assess Circulation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>For child who is breathing 15&ndash;45 breaths/minute without your
                having to open the airway, check the child&rsquo;s pulse in an uninjured
                extremity.
            </li>
            <li>If you feel a pulse, move on to assess mental status.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>If you do not feel a pulse, tag the child Priority 1 (red tag).</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Step 3. Assess Mental Status </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>For a child who is breathing and has a pulse, assess mental status with
                AVPU assessment.
            </li>
            <li>A child who is alert and responds to your voice or pain is tagged
                Priority 2 (yellow tag).
            </li>
            <li>A child who does not respond or who only responds inappropriately to
                pain is considered unresponsive and tagged Priority 1 (red tag).
            </li>
        </ul>
