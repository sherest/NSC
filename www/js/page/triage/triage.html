        <h1>START Triage Categories </h1>
        <h2>Priority 1&mdash;Red&mdash;Immediate care needed</h2>
        <p>Patients with airway and breathing difficulties, uncontrolled or severe bleeding,
            or decreased mental status</p>
        <h2>Priority 2&mdash;Yellow&mdash;Delayed care </h2>
        <p>Responsive patients with burns without airway problems; major or multiple bone or
            joint injuries; back injuries with or without spinal cord damage; and responsive
            patients with other serious injuries without threats to breathing or
            circulation</p>
        <h2>Priority 3&mdash;Green&mdash;Hold care</h2>
        <p>Responsive patients with minor painful, swollen, deformed extremities, or minor
            soft-tissue injuries</p>
        <h2>Priority 4&mdash;Black&mdash;No care needed</h2>
        <p>Obviously dead or dying patients</p>
        <h1>START Triage Assessment </h1>
        <h2>Step 1. Assess Breathing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Check whether the patient is breathing normally.</li>
            <li>If the patient is breathing at rate of below 30 breaths/ minute, move on
                to assess perfusion or circulation.
            </li>
            <li>If the patient is breathing at rate faster than 30 breaths/minute, tag
                the patient Priority 1 (red tag).
            </li>
            <li>If the patient is not breathing, position the head to open the airway.
            </li>
            <li>If still not breathing, tag the patient Priority 4 (black tag).</li>
            <li>If the patient is breathing when the airway is opened, tag the patient
                Priority 1 (red tag) because the patient needs airway support.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step 2. Assess Perfusion or Circulation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For a patient who is breathing without your having to open the airway,
                next assess perfusion or circulation.
            </li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to check for a pulse or check capillary refill.
            </li>
            <li>If there is a pulse or if capillary refill time is less than 2 seconds,
                move on to assess mental status.
            </li>
            <li>If you find no pulse or capillary refill time is longer than 2 seconds,
                tag the patient Priority 1 (red tag).
            </li>
            <li>If the patient is bleeding severely, quickly apply a pressure dressing
                to control bleeding.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 3. Assess Mental Status </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For a patient who is breathing and has a pulse or capillary refill time
                under 2 seconds, assess mental status by giving the patient a simple
                command: &ldquo;Open your eyes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Squeeze my
                hand.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Patients who follow your command are considered alert and responsive and
                are tagged Priority 2 (yellow tag).
            </li>
            <li>Patients who cannot follow a simple command are considered unresponsive
                and are tagged Priority 1 (red tag).
            </li>
        </ul>
