        <h1>Care for Maternal Bleeding After Delivery</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>To stimulate the uterus to contract and reduce bleeding, massage the motherâ€™s abdomen below the navel, where you feel the uterus as a mass about the size of a softball.</li>
            <li>Explain to the mother that this helps stop the bleeding.</li>
            <li>Gently massage with your palms, using a kneading motion in a continuous circular motion.</li>
            <li>If bleeding persists:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Be sure you are kneading, not rubbing, with your palms.</li>
                <li>Keep the mother still and calm while waiting for additional EMS resources.</li>
                <li>Treat her for shock.</li>
                <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
                <li>Encourage breastfeeding, which stimulates contraction of the uterus.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
