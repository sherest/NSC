        <h1>Assessing Childbirth Imminence</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask whether the “bloody show” has occurred.</li>
            <li>When did contractions begin? How close together are they and how long does each last? (Time from beginning of one to beginning of the next.) If less than 5 minutes apart and each lasts 45-60 seconds, delivery may occur soon – make preparations. When contractions are about 2 minutes apart, delivery will likely occur soon.</li>
            <li>Ask whether the woman feels a strong urge to push or feels like she is having a bowel movement– may mean imminent delivery.</li>
            <li>If other signs are suggestive, check for infant’s head crowning. If possible, ask a woman to look. If so, be prepared for delivery very soon – <em>not</em> preparing the woman for transport.</li>
