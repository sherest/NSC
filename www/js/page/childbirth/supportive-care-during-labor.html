        <h1>Supportive Care During Labor</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure a plan is in place for the womanâ€™s transport to planned childbirth location or the arrival of a planned attendant.</li>
            <li>Help the woman rest in whatever position is most comfortable.</li>
            <li>Provide desired comfort measures, such as massaging the lower back (may help reduce pain). The woman should not eat or drink but may suck on ice chips or moisten lips.</li>
            <li>Do not let the woman bathe if the amniotic sac has ruptured.</li>
            <li>Time the length and interval of contractions, and write this down.</li>
            <li>Remind the woman to control her breathing: short, quick breaths (panting) during contractions, and deep, slow breaths between.</li>
            <li>Help calm and reassure the woman. (Anxiety and fear add to pain.) Regular deep breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth may help her relax. (Use the same technique yourself, in sync with the woman.)</li>
