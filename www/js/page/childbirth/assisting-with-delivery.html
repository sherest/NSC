            <li>Help the woman to lie on her back with hips elevated and knees bent and apart and feet flat on the bed.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If she feels faint or dizzy, use pillows or blankets under her right side to position her slightly on her left side.</li>
                <li>She may have been trained already in other acceptable birthing positions.</li>
                <li>Ensure that she is not wearing undergarments or clothing that could get in the way.</li>
                <li>If she prefers, cover her above the knees with a blanket or sheet.</li>
                <li>Place folded towels or blanket under her buttocks.</li>
                <li>Do not try to delay the birth by having her hold her legs together or any other maneuver.</li>
                <li>Talk to her and tell her what is happening throughout.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>As the infant’s head appears, have your gloved hands ready to receive and support the head, which may emerge very quickly.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not interfere with the birth or touch the infant until the head is completely out.</li>
                    <li>Check that the head is not covered by the amniotic sac; if so, pull it away as mouth and nose emerge.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>As head emerges (usually face down), support the head.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If umbilical cord is wrapped around the infant’s neck, carefully slip it over the head or shoulder to prevent strangulation. Avoid putting pressure on the cord or pulling it.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>After the head is out, have woman stop pushing and breathe in a panting manner.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there is a delay before the shoulders emerge, suction the newborn’s mouth and nose.</li>
                    <li>Support the infant as body emerges, often quickly after the head.</li>
                    <li>Do not pull on the head or shoulders.</li>
                    <li>Usually the infant turns to side as the shoulder emerges.</li>
                    <li>Newborns are usually very slippery and should be handled carefully. Grasp the infant’s feet as they emerge.</li>
                    <li>Note the time of birth.</li>
                    <li>If mother is having multiple births, prepare for delivery of second infant. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Position the newborn on its side, at level of the vagina, with head lower than feet for secretions to drain from the nose and mouth.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a bulb syringe to gently suction secretions from the mouth first and then the nose, or wipe both with sterile gauze.</li>
                    <li>If you don’t have a bulb syringe, gently stroke downward on the baby's nose to help expel excess mucus and amniotic fluid.</li>
                    <li>The newborn normally begins to cry. If not, gently flick bottom of feet with a finger or gently rub its back.</li>
                    <li>If newborn is still not crying, check for breathing and give ventilations if needed.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Gently dry and wrap the infant in a towel or blanket to prevent heat loss, keeping the cord loose and free of compression and kinks.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not wash infant’s skin, eyes  or ears.</li>
                    <li>Place the infant it on the mother’s abdomen, on its side with the head low for nose and mouth to drain.  If you cannot place the newborn here for any reason, keep it warm and above the level of the mother’s heart.</li>
                    <li>Only if the infant must be separated from the mother in order to provide emergency care should the cord be cut.</li>
                    <li>Ensure infant stays warm and continues to breathe.</li>
                    <li>The mother can begin nursing the infant immediately (helps uterus contract and stop bleeding).</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Follow local protocol to clamp or tie the umbilical cord or leave it intact for arriving EMS personnel.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is often not necessary to tie or cut the umbilical cord, even after placenta has been delivered, when medical help will arrive soon.   If help may be delayed, clamp or tie and cut the cord before delivery of placenta.</li>
                    <li>Wait until cord stops pulsating, and clamp or tie a tight knot around the cord about 10 inches from the infant, using strips of gauze, string, or thin strips of cloth.</li>
                    <li>Clamp or tie a second knot about 7 inches from the infant, and cut the cord between the two ties with sterilized scissors or a sterile scalpel. </li>
                </ul>

            <li>Wait for delivery of placenta and umbilical cord, usually with milder contractions in 10-30 minutes. Do not pull on the umbilical cord to pull out the placenta.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blood often gushes out as the placenta detaches from the uterus.</li>
                    <li>Keep placenta at level of infant while waiting for EMS personnel. Save the placenta in a plastic bag or towel for health care providers to examine.</li>
                    <li>Place a sanitary pad over vaginal opening to help control bleeding, and lower the woman’s legs together.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Continue to monitor both mother and newborn.</li>
