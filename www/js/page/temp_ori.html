    <li>Use for an unresponsive breathing patient not suspected to have a spinal injury.</li>
    <li>It helps keep the airway open so that you do not need to maintain the head tilt&ndash;chin lift or

        <h1>Signs and Symptoms of Respiratory Distress</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Gasping for air&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Panting&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Breathing faster or slower than normal&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Wheezing or other sounds with breathing&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Using accessory muscles&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Inability to speak a full sentence without pausing to breathe&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Skin is pale, cool, and moist; lips and nail beds are bluish (cyanosis)</li>
            <li>Dizziness or disorientation&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

            <li>Sitting and leaning forward, hands on knees</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Inadequate Breathing</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Inadequate breathing is breathing too slowly (less than 10 breaths/minute) or too weakly.
            </li>
            <li>Patient likely has altered mental status and may have cyanotic appearance.</li>
            <li>Patient needs ventilations.</li>
            <li>Do not wait for respiratory arrest before providing ventilations for an adult who is not
                breathing adequately.
            </li>
            <li>An infant or child may have a pulse of 60 or higher but still be breathing inadequately and
                need ventilation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Emergency Care for Respiratory Distress</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Help the patient rest in a position of easiest breathing (often sitting up).</li>
            <li>Ask the patient about any prescribed medicine, and help the patient take it if needed.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to give BLS, because respiratory distress may progress to respiratory arrest.
            </li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
            <li>Use suction as needed to maintain the airway.</li>
            <li>Because respiratory distress in an infant or a child may rapidly progress to arrest, act
                quickly when an infant or a child is having problems breathing.

            <li>Do not completely bandage over fingers or toes, and assess them for CSM frequently
                after splinting. Swelling, pale or bluish discoloration, tingling or numbness, and

            <li>For a patient who is breathing and has a pulse or capillary refill time
                under 2 seconds, assess mental status by giving the patient a simple
                command: &ldquo;Open your eyes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Squeeze my
                hand.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Patients who follow your command are considered alert and responsive and
                are tagged Priority 2 (yellow tag).

            <li>Patients who cannot follow a simple command are considered unresponsive
                and are tagged Priority 1 (red tag).

        <h1>Step 1. Assess Breathing</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Check whether the child is breathing.</li>
            <li>If the child is breathing at rate of 15&ndash;45 breaths/minute, move on
                to assess circulation.
            </li>
            <li>If the child is breathing slower than 15 or faster than 45
                breaths/minute, or if breathing is irregular, tag the child Priority 1
                (red tag).
            </li>
            <li>If the child is not breathing, open the airway.</li>
            <li>If still not breathing, look in the mouth for a foreign body and remove
                it if &nbsp;seen.
            </li>
            <li>If the child is now breathing, tag child Priority 1 (red tag).</li>
            <li>If not breathing, check for a pulse.</li>
            <li>If no pulse, tag the child Priority 4 (black tag).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Give a child with a pulse 5 ventilations; if the child begins breathing,
                tag the child red and move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>If the child does not begin breathing, tag the child black.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Step 2. Assess Circulation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>For child who is breathing 15&ndash;45 breaths/minute without your
                having to open the airway, check the child&rsquo;s pulse in an uninjured
                extremity.
            </li>
            <li>If you feel a pulse, move on to assess mental status.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>If you do not feel a pulse, tag the child Priority 1 (red tag).</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Step 3. Assess Mental Status </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>For a child who is breathing and has a pulse, assess mental status with
                AVPU assessment.
            </li>
            <li>A child who is alert and responds to your voice or pain is tagged
                Priority 2 (yellow tag).
            </li>
            <li>A child who does not respond or who only responds inappropriately to
                pain is considered unresponsive and tagged Priority 1 (red tag).

        <ol>
            <li>If the patient has a pulse but is not breathing normally, open the
                airway and give a breath over 1 second, watching the chest rise and
                letting it fall.
            </li>
            <li>If the first breath does not go in, try again to open the airway and
                give another rescue breath. If it still does not go in, the patient may
                be choking. Proceed to CPR for choking. (See Airway Obstruction in Any
                Unresponsive Patient, page 59<strong>.</strong>)
            </li>
            <li>If your breath goes in, continue rescue breathing. Give each breath over
                1 second, at rate of 10-12 breaths per minute (1 breath every 5-6
                seconds) for an adult; 12-20 breaths per minute for a child or infant (1
                breath every 3-5 seconds).
            </li>
            <li>Check the pulse about every 2 minutes. If there is no pulse, provide CPR
                beginning with chest compressions (pages 45-47<strong>.</strong>)

            <li>Rescuer 2 positions hands on the mask: thumbs and index fingers
                circling each side, other three fingers behind the lower jawbone.
                Pull jaw up into mask rather than pushing mask down on jaw.
            </li>
            <li>Rescuer 2 opens the airway and seals the mask to the patient&rsquo;s
                face.

                place).
