        <h1>Emergency Care for Chemical Burns</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Send someone to get the SDS for the chemical.</li>
            <li>Wear gloves and eye protection.</li>
            <li>Move the patient from confined area or ventilate the area because of the risk of fumes.</li>
            <li>With a dry chemical, first brush it off the patient’s skin with a gloved hand or cloth. Avoid contaminating unexposed skin.</li>
            <li>Flush the area as quickly as possible with large amounts of running water. Continue flushing until additional EMS personnel arrive or until a toxic-specific solution is available. Do not try to neutralize an acid by applying an alkaline substance or vice versa.</li>
            <li>Remove clothing and jewelry from the burn area while flushing with water.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>For a chemical splash in the eye:</h1>
        <p>Flush the eye immediately with large amounts of clean running water for at least 15 minutes or until additional EMS personnel arrive. If tap water is not available, use normal saline or a commercial eye irrigation solution. Have the patient remove a contact lens. Tilt the patient’s head so that the water runs away from the face and not into the other eye. Follow local protocol to consult the Poison Control Center for additional treatment guidance.</p>
