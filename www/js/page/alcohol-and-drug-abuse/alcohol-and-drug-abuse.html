        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>For <b>responsive patient:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay with patient and protect from injury (take away car keys).</li>
                <li>Do not let patient lie down on the back.</li>
                <li>Care for injuries.</li>
                <li>For responsive patient known to have taken a drug or other substance, follow local protocol to call the Poison Control Center and follow instructions.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>For <b>unresponsive patient:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Position patient in recovery position; be prepared for vomiting.</li>
                <li>Monitor breathing and provide BLS if necessary.</li>
                <li>In cold environment, intoxicated patient is likely to experience hypothermia. Keep patient warm.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li>For <b>injured intoxicated patient:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not rely on patient’s perception of injury to guide care because alcohol may keep patient from feeling pain.</li>
                <li>Give emergency care as if patient were unresponsive, based on signs of injury or illness rather than reported symptoms.</li>
                <li>If mechanism of injury suggests possible spinal injury, do not move patient but keep head aligned with the body.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Provide care for any condition that occurs (e.g., seizures, shock, cardiac arrest).</li>
            <li>Keep patient from harming self or others.</li>
            <li>Do not try to induce vomiting, which may cause further harm and is unlikely to help the patient.</li>
            <li>Alcohol and some drugs make some people hostile and violent. Stay away and call law enforcement if violence threatens.</li>
            <li>When illegal drugs are involved, protect the crime scene.</li>

        <h1>Opioid Drug Overdose</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Provide the general care for drug abuse and overdose emergencies.</li>
            <li>Try to learn what drug was taken and activate EMS (if you are not part of the EMS response) Call immediately for an unresponsive patient.</li>
            <li>If possible, administer naloxone to the patient to counteract the opioid drug’s effects.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Naloxone is the drug in an emergency overdose kit (such as Narcan).</li>
                <li>A naloxone emergency kit may be present at the scene, or the patient’s family may have or know of a nearby emergency kit.</li>
                <li>Naloxone may be administered intramuscularly via an auto-injector (like an emergency epinephrine auto-injector for a severe allergic reaction) or intranasally via a nasal device.</li>
                <li>To administer the drug, always follow the instructions on the kit.</li>
                <li>Additional doses may be required if the patient’s signs do not improve before additional emergency personnel arrive.</li>
                <li>Note that you do not have to be absolutely certain that the patient has taken an opioid drug, because naloxone will not harm a patient with these signs and symptoms due to some other cause.</li>
