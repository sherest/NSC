        <h1>Opioid Drug Overdose</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Provide the general care for drug abuse and overdose emergencies.</li>
            <li>Try to learn what drug was taken and activate EMS (if you are not part of the EMS response) Call immediately for an unresponsive patient.</li>
            <li>If possible, administer naloxone to the patient to counteract the opioid drug’s effects.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Naloxone is the drug in an emergency overdose kit (such as Narcan).</li>
                <li>A naloxone emergency kit may be present at the scene, or the patient’s family may have or know of a nearby emergency kit.</li>
                <li>Naloxone may be administered intramuscularly via an auto-injector (like an emergency epinephrine auto-injector for a severe allergic reaction) or intranasally via a nasal device.</li>
                <li>To administer the drug, always follow the instructions on the kit.</li>
                <li>Additional doses may be required if the patient’s signs do not improve before additional emergency personnel arrive.</li>
                <li>Note that you do not have to be absolutely certain that the patient has taken an opioid drug, because naloxone will not harm a patient with these signs and symptoms due to some other cause.</li>
