    	<h1>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)</h1>
        <h1>Call First vs. Call Fast</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>When alone with an adult patient, immediately call first for help and an AED, as soon as the patient is identified as unresponsive, before providing CPR, except as noted below.</li>
            <li>For infant or child (more likely to have airway obstruction), call fast for help and an AED after providing 5 cycles of CPR (about 2 minutes). For unresponsive patients in cardiac arrest due to likely asphyxial arrest (drowning patient), call fast. Give 5 cycles of CPR (about 2 minutes) before stopping to call for help. </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>1-Rescuer CPR</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the emergency response system. Determine that the unresponsive patient is not breathing normally and has no pulse.</li>
            <li>Expose the chest. Put your hand(s) in correct position for chest compressions.</li>
            <li>Give 30 chest compressions hard and fast at least 2 inches deep in an adult (but not more than 2.4 inches) and at least ⅓ the depth of the chest in an infant (about 1½ inches) or child (about 2 inches) at a rate of 100-120 per minute. Count aloud for a steady, fast rate: “1, 2, 3...” Then give 2 breaths.</li>
            <li>Open the airway and give 2 rescue breaths, each over 1 second, to cause a visible chest rise.  (If the first breath does not go in, reposition the patient’s head and try again; if the second breath still does not go in, give choking care.)</li>
            <li>Continue cycles of 30 compressions and 2 ventilations.</li>
            <li>Continue CPR until:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The patient is breathing normally and has a pulse</li>
                    <li>An AED is brought to the scene and is ready to use</li>
                    <li>Personnel with more training arrive and take over</li>
                    <li>if the patient starts breathing normally and has a pulse but is unresponsive, put the patient in the recovery position and monitor breathing and pulse.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>When an AED arrives and is ready to be used, start the AED sequence for a patient who is not breathing normally and has no pulse.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>2-Rescuer CPR for Adults and Children</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>At patient’s head, Rescuer 1 checks for unresponsiveness, normal breathing, and a pulse simultaneously for no longer than 10 seconds. Rescuer 2 ensures AED has been summoned. Rescuer 2 locates the site for chest compressions.</li>
            <li>Rescuer 1 indicates, “No pulse.” Rescuer 2 gives 30 compressions for adult (15 for a child) at rate of 100-120 per minute, then pauses.</li>
            <li>Rescuer 1 gives 2 breaths.</li>
            <li>Rescuers continue cycles of 30 compressions in adult (15 in child) and 2 breaths for about 2 minutes (or after 5 cycles of compressions and ventilations at a ratio of 30:2) before switching compressor and ventilator roles in less than 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>Rescuers continue CPR until:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The patient is breathing normally and has a pulse</li>
                    <li>An AED is brought to the scene and is ready to use</li>
                    <li>Help arrives and takes over</li>
                    <li>if patient starts breathing normally and has pulse but is unresponsive, put in recovery position and monitor breathing and pulse.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>When AED arrives and is ready to be used, start AED sequence for patient who is not breathing normally and has no pulse. </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>2-Rescuer CPR for Infants</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Rescuer giving compressions places thumbs of both hands together in correct position on sternum (just below nipple line).</li>
            <li>Fingers of both hands encircle infant’s chest.</li>
            <li>Chest is compressed with both thumbs while chest is squeezed with fingers.</li>
        </ul>
        <img ng-src="./img/pages/cpr/cpr-infants.png">
        <ol>
            <li>At infant’s head, Rescuer 1 checks for normal breathing and pulse. At infant’s feet, Rescuer 2 positions hands in chest-encircling position for chest compressions with both thumbs.</li>
            <li>If pulse is absent, Rescuer 1 says, “No pulse.” Rescuer 2 gives 15 chest compressions at rate of 100-120 per minute, counting aloud for a fast, steady rate, then pauses.</li>
            <li>Rescuer 1 gives 2 breaths.</li>
            <li>Rescuers continue cycles of 15 compressions and 2 breaths for about 2 minutes before switching compressor and ventilator roles in less than 5 seconds. Rescuers continue CPR until:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The infant is breathing normally and has a pulse</li>
                <li>An AED is brought to the scene and is ready to use</li>
                <li>More advanced help arrives and takes over</li>
                <li>If infant starts breathing normally but is unresponsive, hold in recovery position and monitor breathing and pulse.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When AED arrives and is ready to be used, start AED sequence for infant who is not breathing normally and has no pulse.</li>
        </ol>
