        <ul>
            <li>Rescuer giving compressions places thumbs of both hands together in correct position on sternum (just below nipple line).</li>
            <li>Fingers of both hands encircle infant’s chest.</li>

            <li>At infant’s head, Rescuer 1 checks for normal breathing and pulse. At infant’s feet, Rescuer 2 positions hands in chest-encircling position for chest compressions with both thumbs.</li>
            <li>If pulse is absent, Rescuer 1 says, “No pulse.” Rescuer 2 gives 15 chest compressions at rate of 100-120 per minute, counting aloud for a fast, steady rate, then pauses.</li>
            <li>Rescuer 1 gives 2 breaths.</li>
            <li>Rescuers continue cycles of 15 compressions and 2 breaths for about 2 minutes before switching compressor and ventilator roles in less than 5 seconds. Rescuers continue CPR until:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The infant is breathing normally and has a pulse</li>
                <li>An AED is brought to the scene and is ready to use</li>
                <li>More advanced help arrives and takes over</li>
                <li>If infant starts breathing normally but is unresponsive, hold in recovery position and monitor breathing and pulse.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When AED arrives and is ready to be used, start AED sequence for infant who is not breathing normally and has no pulse.</li>
