        <h1>1-Rescuer CPR</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the emergency response system. Determine that the unresponsive patient is not breathing normally and has no pulse.</li>
            <li>Expose the chest. Put your hand(s) in correct position for chest compressions.</li>
            <li>Give 30 chest compressions hard and fast at least 2 inches deep in an adult (but not more than 2.4 inches) and at least ⅓ the depth of the chest in an infant (about 1½ inches) or child (about 2 inches) at a rate of 100-120 per minute. Count aloud for a steady, fast rate: “1, 2, 3...” Then give 2 breaths.</li>
            <li>Open the airway and give 2 rescue breaths, each over 1 second, to cause a visible chest rise.  (If the first breath does not go in, reposition the patient’s head and try again; if the second breath still does not go in, give choking care.)</li>
            <li>Continue cycles of 30 compressions and 2 ventilations.</li>
            <li>Continue CPR until:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The patient is breathing normally and has a pulse</li>
                    <li>An AED is brought to the scene and is ready to use</li>
                    <li>Personnel with more training arrive and take over</li>
                    <li>if the patient starts breathing normally and has a pulse but is unresponsive, put the patient in the recovery position and monitor breathing and pulse.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>When an AED arrives and is ready to be used, start the AED sequence for a patient who is not breathing normally and has no pulse.</li>
