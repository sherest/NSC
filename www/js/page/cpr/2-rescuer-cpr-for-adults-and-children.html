        <h1>2-Rescuer CPR for Adults and Children</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>At patient’s head, Rescuer 1 checks for unresponsiveness, normal breathing, and a pulse simultaneously for no longer than 10 seconds. Rescuer 2 ensures AED has been summoned. Rescuer 2 locates the site for chest compressions.</li>
            <li>Rescuer 1 indicates, “No pulse.” Rescuer 2 gives 30 compressions for adult (15 for a child) at rate of 100-120 per minute, then pauses.</li>
            <li>Rescuer 1 gives 2 breaths.</li>
            <li>Rescuers continue cycles of 30 compressions in adult (15 in child) and 2 breaths for about 2 minutes (or after 5 cycles of compressions and ventilations at a ratio of 30:2) before switching compressor and ventilator roles in less than 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>Rescuers continue CPR until:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The patient is breathing normally and has a pulse</li>
                    <li>An AED is brought to the scene and is ready to use</li>
                    <li>Help arrives and takes over</li>
                    <li>if patient starts breathing normally and has pulse but is unresponsive, put in recovery position and monitor breathing and pulse.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>When AED arrives and is ready to be used, start AED sequence for patient who is not breathing normally and has no pulse. </li>
        </ol>
