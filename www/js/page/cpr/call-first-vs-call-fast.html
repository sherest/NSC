        <h1>Call First vs. Call Fast</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>When alone with an adult patient, immediately call first for help and an AED, as soon as the patient is identified as unresponsive, before providing CPR, except as noted below.</li>
            <li>For infant or child (more likely to have airway obstruction), call fast for help and an AED after providing 5 cycles of CPR (about 2 minutes). For unresponsive patients in cardiac arrest due to likely asphyxial arrest (drowning patient), call fast. Give 5 cycles of CPR (about 2 minutes) before stopping to call for help. </li>
        </ul>
