        <h1>Emergency Care for Diabetic Emergencies</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Talk to the patient and confirm he or she has diabetes; look for a medical alert ID.</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if it is available and you are so trained.</li>
            <li>If a diabetic patient becomes unresponsive, do not try to inject insulin or put food or fluids in the patient’s mouth.</li>
            <li>For hypoglycemia:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure the patient can maintain an open airway (for example, if the patient can speak).</li>
                <li>Follow local protocol to give the patient sugar: preferably 3-5 glucose tablets, or if glucose tablets are unavailable, another source of dietary sugar such as 8 ounces of orange juice,  5 sugar packets (but not artificial sugar or sweetener packets), or several pieces of candy (such as 15-20 jelly beans or 20-25 Skittles).(See also <a ui-sref="app.medication.glucosePasteForHypoglycemia">Glucose under Medications</a>.)</li>
                <li>If the patient still feels ill or has signs and symptoms after 15 minutes, give more sugar.</li>
                <li>Call for help if the patient becomes unresponsive or continues to have significant signs and symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>For hyperglycemia:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you suspect high blood sugar, call for help and monitor the patient. In the early stage, you may not be able to tell whether the patient suffers from high or low blood sugar. In this case:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give glucose tablets or sugar as for hypoglycemia.</li>
                    <li>If the patient does not improve within 15 minutes, or the patient’s signs and symptoms become worse, call for help.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>In the later stage, high blood sugar is a medical emergency:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Call for help immediately.</li>
                    <li>Put an unresponsive patient in the recovery position and monitor breathing and vital signs.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ol>
