        <h1>Consent </h1>
        <h1>Expressed Consent</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify yourself to the patient.</li>
            <li>State your level of training.</li>
            <li>Explain what you think may be wrong.</li>
            <li>Describe the care you plan to give and its benefits.</li>
            <li>Explain any risks related to care.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Implied Consent</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Implied for a patient who is unresponsive, confused or seriously injured who cannot give expressed consent for lifesaving care.</li>
            <li>Applies to children and mentally incompetent adults who need emergency care when a parent or guardian is not present.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>When a Victim Refuses Consent</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Follow local protocol. When in doubt, err in favor of providing care.</li>
            <li>Do not argue with the victim or question the victim&rsquo;s personal beliefs.</li>
            <li>Do not try to give care. Touching a victim who refuses care may make you guilty of battery.</li>
            <li>Wait for responding EMS units to arrive and evaluate situation. Do not make independent decision regarding refusal of care.</li>
            <li>If possible, have the victim sign a witnessed refusal form or have a witness hear the victim&rsquo;s refusal.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>If an Advance Directive Is Present</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Follow local protocol based on state laws.</li>
            <li>A DNR order refers only to resuscitative care for victims in cardiac arrest &ndash; it does not refer to other treatments.</li>
            <li>If there is any doubt, or if a written directive is not present, give care as usual.</li>
            <li>Other adults or family members cannot refuse care for victim without a formal advance directive.</li>
            <li>If family members ask you to provide care, even when a DNR order is present, it is usually best to give care until responding EMS professionals arrive.</li>
        </ol>
