        <h1>Expressed Consent</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify yourself to the patient.</li>
            <li>State your level of training.</li>
            <li>Explain what you think may be wrong.</li>

        <ul>

        <h1>When a Victim Refuses Consent</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow local protocol. When in doubt, err in favor of providing care.</li>
            <li>Do not argue with the victim or question the victim’s personal beliefs.</li>

                regarding refusal of care.
            </li>
            <li>If possible, have the victim sign a witnessed refusal form or have a witness hear the victim’s
                refusal.
