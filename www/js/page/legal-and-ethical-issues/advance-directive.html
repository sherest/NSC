            <li>Follow local protocol based on state laws.</li>
            <li>A DNR order refers only to resuscitative care for victims in cardiac arrest &ndash; it does not refer to other treatments.</li>
            <li>If there is any doubt, or if a written directive is not present, give care as usual.</li>
            <li>Other adults or family members cannot refuse care for victim without a formal advance directive.</li>
            <li>If family members ask you to provide care, even when a DNR order is present, it is usually best to give care until responding EMS professionals arrive.</li>
