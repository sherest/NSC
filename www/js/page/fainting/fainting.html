        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>If fainting is anticipated, have the patient sit or lie down.</li>
            <li>Injury may result if a fainting patient falls – try to catch the patient and gently lower to the floor.</li>
            <li>Unless the patient may have spinal or leg injury, lay the patient down and raise legs about 6 to 12 inches.</li>
            <li>Loosen constricting clothing.</li>
            <li>Check for possible injuries caused by falling.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to provide BLS if needed.</li>
            <li>Place a patient who is breathing normally but remains unresponsive in the recovery position.</li>
            <li>Reassure the patient as he or she recovers.</li>
            <li>Do not pour or splash water on the patient’s face (could be aspirated into the lungs).</li>
            <li>Do not use ammonia inhalants or similar remedies to arouse the patient.</li>
            <li>Activate EMS if the patient does not regain responsiveness soon or faints repeatedly. Always call EMS for older adults, people with heart disease, and pregnant women.</li>
