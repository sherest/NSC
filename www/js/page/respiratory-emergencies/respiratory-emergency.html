        <h1>Signs and Symptoms of Respiratory Distress</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Gasping for air</li>
            <li>Panting</li>
            <li>Breathing faster or slower than normal</li>
            <li>Wheezing or other sounds with breathing</li>
            <li>Using accessory muscles</li>
            <li>Inability to speak a full sentence without pausing to breathe</li>
            <li>Skin is pale, cool, and moist; lips and nail beds are bluish (cyanosis)</li>
            <li>Dizziness or disorientation</li>
            <li>Feelings of extreme distress</li>
            <li>Sitting and leaning forward, hands on knees </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Inadequate Breathing</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Inadequate breathing is breathing too slowly (less than 10 breaths/minute) or too weakly.</li>
            <li>Patient likely has altered mental status and may have cyanotic appearance.</li>
            <li>Patient needs ventilations.</li>
            <li>Do not wait for respiratory arrest before providing ventilations for an adult who is not breathing adequately.</li>
            <li>An infant or child may have a pulse of 60 or higher but still be breathing inadequately and need ventilation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Emergency Care for Respiratory Distress</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Help the patient rest in a position of easiest breathing (often sitting up).</li>
            <li>Ask the patient about any prescribed medicine, and help the patient take it if needed.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to give BLS, because respiratory distress may progress to respiratory arrest.
            </li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
            <li>Use suction as needed to maintain the airway.</li>
            <li>Because respiratory distress in an infant or a child may rapidly progress to arrest, act
                quickly when an infant or a child is having problems breathing.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Emergency Care for an Asthma Attack</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to assist the patient in using his or her medication (usually a
                metered dose inhaler) when:

                <ul>
                    <li>Patient confirms it is an asthma attack.</li>
                    <li>Patient identifies the inhaler as his or her prescribed asthma medication.</li>
                    <li>Patient cannot self-administer the medication.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Help the patient rest and sit in a position for easiest breathing.</li>
            <li>Patient may use an inhaler again if needed.</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to give oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
        </ol>
