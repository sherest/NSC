        <h1>Inadequate Breathing</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Inadequate breathing is breathing too slowly (less than 10 breaths/minute) or too weakly.</li>
            <li>Patient likely has altered mental status and may have cyanotic appearance.</li>
            <li>Patient needs ventilations.</li>
            <li>Do not wait for respiratory arrest before providing ventilations for an adult who is not breathing adequately.</li>
            <li>An infant or child may have a pulse of 60 or higher but still be breathing inadequately and need ventilation.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Emergency Care for Respiratory Distress</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Help the patient rest in a position of easiest breathing (often sitting up).</li>
            <li>Ask the patient about any prescribed medicine, and help the patient take it if needed.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to give BLS, because respiratory distress may progress to respiratory arrest.
            </li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
            <li>Use suction as needed to maintain the airway.</li>
            <li>Because respiratory distress in an infant or a child may rapidly progress to arrest, act
                quickly when an infant or a child is having problems breathing.
            </li>
        </ol>
