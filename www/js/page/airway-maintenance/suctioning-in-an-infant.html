            <li>Watch for decreased heart rate, and if pulse is slow, stop suctioning and provide ventilation.</li>
            <li>Be especially careful not to suction too deep.</li>
            <li>Always suction mouth before nostrils (suctioning nose may stimulate infant to breathe in and inhale fluid or secretions from mouth).</li>
