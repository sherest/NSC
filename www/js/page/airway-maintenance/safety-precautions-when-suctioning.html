        <h1>Safety Precautions When Suctioning</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Be careful with the suction tip because of strong suction pressure.</li>
            <li>Avoid prolonged contact with mucous membranes in mouth and nose, which can cause bruising, swelling, or bleeding.</li>
            <li>Never insert the suction tip farther than you can see or deeper than base of tongue.</li>
            <li>Do not suction more than:
                <ul>
                    <li>15 seconds at a time for adults</li>
                    <li>10 seconds at a time for children</li>
                    <li>5 seconds at a time for infants</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Vigorous suctioning may stimulate the gag reflex, causing vomiting.</li>
            <li>Follow standard precautions for body fluids.</li>
            <li>Correctly dispose of contents in reservoir of suction device, and clean device according to the manufacturerâ€™s recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Suctioning in an Infant</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Watch for decreased heart rate, and if pulse is slow, stop suctioning and provide ventilation.</li>
            <li>Be especially careful not to suction too deep.</li>
            <li>Always suction mouth before nostrils (suctioning nose may stimulate infant to breathe in and inhale fluid or secretions from mouth).</li>
        </ul>
