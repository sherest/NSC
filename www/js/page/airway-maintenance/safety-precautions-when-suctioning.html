        <h1>Safety Precautions When Suctioning</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Be careful with the suction tip because of strong suction pressure.</li>
            <li>Avoid prolonged contact with mucous membranes in mouth and nose, which can cause bruising, swelling, or bleeding.</li>
            <li>Never insert the suction tip farther than you can see or deeper than base of tongue.</li>
            <li>Do not suction more than:
                <ul>
                    <li>15 seconds at a time for adults</li>
                    <li>10 seconds at a time for children</li>
                    <li>5 seconds at a time for infants</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Vigorous suctioning may stimulate the gag reflex, causing vomiting.</li>
            <li>Follow standard precautions for body fluids.</li>
            <li>Correctly dispose of contents in reservoir of suction device, and clean device according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Suctioning in an Infant</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Watch for decreased heart rate, and if pulse is slow, stop suctioning and provide ventilation.</li>
            <li>Be especially careful not to suction too deep.</li>
            <li>Always suction mouth before nostrils (suctioning nose may stimulate infant to breathe in and inhale fluid or secretions from mouth).</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Suctioning – Adult or Child</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Confirm the suction device is working.</li>
            <li>Turn patient’s head to one side and open mouth with one hand (with spinal injury, support head and turn it with body as a unit).</li>
            <li>Sweep out solids and larger amounts of fluid with index finger of other hand.</li>
            <li>Determine maximum depth of insertion by measuring catheter tip from earlobe to corner of mouth.</li>
            <li>Turn on suction, or pump handle, to create suction.</li>
            <li>Insert catheter tip carefully into patient’s mouth. Put your finger over the opening to suction, and move tip about as you withdraw it.</li> 
            <li>Reposition patient’s head with airway open, and begin or resume ventilation if needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Suctioning – Infant</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Hold infant in position for suctioning, with head lower than body and turned to one side.</li>
            <li>Squeeze suction bulb first and then gently insert tip into infant’s mouth.</li>
            <li>Gradually release the bulb to create suction as you withdraw tip from the mouth.</li>
            <li>Move the bulb aside and squeeze it with tip down to empty it.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2-4 until the airway is clear, up to 3 times.</li>
            <li>Repeat suctioning process for each nostril.</li> 
            <li>Begin or resume ventilation if needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Oral Airway Insertion in Adults</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose correct oral airway size. Measure from corner of the lips to tip of earlobe or angle of jaw.</li>
            <li>Open patient’s airway with head tilt–chin lift or jaw thrust, and open the mouth.</li>
            <li>Insert airway device with the tip pointing toward the roof of mouth.</li>
            <li>When tip reaches the back of mouth and you feel resistance, rotate airway 180 degrees.</li>
            <li>Continue to insert airway to final position (with flange resting on lips).</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Oral Airway in Children and Infants</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Select proper size: Measure from corner of lips to bottom of earlobe.</li>
            <li>Open child’s mouth.</li>
            <li>Use tongue blade to press tongue down and out of the way. If a tongue blade is not available, use your index finger to press the base of the tongue down to allow proper positioning of the oral airway.</li>
            <li>Insert airway in the upright (anatomic) position.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Nasal Airway Insertion in Adults</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose correct nasal airway size, measuring from the nostril to the tip of the earlobe. The diameter of airway should not be so large that tissue around nostril turns white from the pressure.</li>
            <li>Coat nasal airway with water-soluble lubricant.</li>
            <li>Insert nasal airway in right nostril with bevel toward the base of nostril or septum.</li>
            <li>Insert nasal airway straight back, sliding it along floor of the nostril. If it cannot be inserted into one nostril, try the other; do not force it.</li>
            <li>Insert nasal airway until flange rests against the nose.</li>
        </ol>
