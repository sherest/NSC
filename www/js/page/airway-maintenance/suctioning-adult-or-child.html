            <li>Confirm the suction device is working.</li>
            <li>Turn patient’s head to one side and open mouth with one hand (with spinal injury, support head and turn it with body as a unit).</li>
            <li>Sweep out solids and larger amounts of fluid with index finger of other hand.</li>
            <li>Determine maximum depth of insertion by measuring catheter tip from earlobe to corner of mouth.</li>
            <li>Turn on suction, or pump handle, to create suction.</li>
            <li>Insert catheter tip carefully into patient’s mouth. Put your finger over the opening to suction, and move tip about as you withdraw it.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Hold infant in position for suctioning, with head lower than body and turned to one side.</li>
            <li>Squeeze suction bulb first and then gently insert tip into infant’s mouth.</li>
            <li>Gradually release the bulb to create suction as you withdraw tip from the mouth.</li>
            <li>Move the bulb aside and squeeze it with tip down to empty it.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2-4 until the airway is clear, up to 3 times.</li>
            <li>Repeat suctioning process for each nostril.</li>
