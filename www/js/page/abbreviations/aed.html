            <li>Position patient away from water and metal. Place AED by patient’s shoulder and turn it on.</li>
            <li>Expose patient’s chest, and quickly dry or shave pad placement area if necessary.</li>
            <li>Apply pads to patient’s chest as shown on pads. If needed, plug cables into unit. Use adult pads for a patient 8 or older. For an infant or child younger than 8, use pediatric pads if available, applied as directed by unit; if pediatric pads are unavailable, use adult pads.</li>
            <li>Stay clear during rhythm analysis.</li>
            <li>Follow prompts from AED to do one of three things: (1) press shock button, (2) stay clear while AED automatically delivers shock, or (3) do not shock but immediately give CPR with pads remaining in place, starting with chest compressions.</li>
            <li>Follow AED’s prompts to analyze the rhythm again after 5 cycles of CPR (about 2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Continue steps 4, 5, and 6 until patient wakes up or more advanced help arrives and takes over.</li>
            <li>If patient begins breathing normally but is unresponsive, put the patient (if no trauma to the neck, back, hip, or pelvis) in recovery position (with pads remaining in place) and continue to monitor breathing and pulse.</li>
