        <h1>Emergency Care for Frostbite </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Remove patient from cold environment, and remove wet or constrictive clothing. Cover patient with
                blanket.
            </li>
            <li>Handle patient very gently.</li>
            <li>Check for hypothermia.</li>
            <li>Protect the cold-injured area from further injury.</li>
            <li>For early or superficial injury:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Manually stabilize and cover extremity.</li>
                <li>Do not rub or massage area.</li>
                <li>Do not allow the area to be re-exposed to cold.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>For late or deep cold injury:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove jewelry and tight-fitting clothing.</li>
                <li>Protect between fingers and toes with dry gauze. Protect the area from being touched or rubbed by
                    clothing or objects.
                </li>
                <li>Do not:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Break blisters</li>
                        <li>Rub or massage area</li>
                        <li>Apply heat</li>
                        <li>Rewarm area if any chance of refreezing</li>
                        <li>Allow patient to walk on affected extremity</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>If help will be delayed, and only if refreezing can be prevented, then severe frostbite can be rewarmed
                by immersing area in lukewarm water (about 99-104°F; 37-40°C) for 20-30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Never apply direct heat source to frostbitten skin.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Hypothermia</h1>
        <h1>Early Signs and Symptoms</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Shivering, numbness, lethargy, poor coordination, drowsiness, slurred speech</li>
            <li>Patients often experience the “umbles”: mumbles, fumbles, stumbles.</li>
            <li>Infants may have bright red skin and little energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Serious Later Signs and Symptoms</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Shivering typically stops and patient may not feel cold.</li>
            <li>Breathing becomes shallow, pulse slows.</li>
            <li>Mental status continues to deteriorate.</li>
            <li>In severe cases, the patient becomes unresponsive and may stop breathing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Emergency Care for Hypothermia</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Remove patient from cold environment.</li>
            <li>Protect from further heat loss: Remove wet clothing and cover with a blanket.</li>
            <li>Have patient lie down, and handle gently (abrupt movement may cause arrhythmia).</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
            <li>Do not allow patient to walk or move about.</li>
            <li>Do not give anything to eat or drink.</li>
            <li>Do not allow patient to use stimulants such as caffeine or nicotine.</li>
            <li>Do not massage the skin or extremities.</li>
            <li>Do not immerse patient in hot water or use direct heat (hot water bottle, heat lamp, heating pad)
                because rapid warming can cause heart problems.
            </li>
            <li>In an unresponsive patient, assess pulse for 30-45 seconds before starting CPR.</li>
            <li>Use AED as usual, following local protocol.</li>
        </ol>
