        <h1>Hypothermia</h1>
        <h1>Early Signs and Symptoms</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Shivering, numbness, lethargy, poor coordination, drowsiness, slurred speech</li>
            <li>Patients often experience the “umbles”: mumbles, fumbles, stumbles.</li>
            <li>Infants may have bright red skin and little energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Serious Later Signs and Symptoms</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Shivering typically stops and patient may not feel cold.</li>
            <li>Breathing becomes shallow, pulse slows.</li>
            <li>Mental status continues to deteriorate.</li>
            <li>In severe cases, the patient becomes unresponsive and may stop breathing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Emergency Care for Hypothermia</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Remove patient from cold environment.</li>
            <li>Protect from further heat loss: Remove wet clothing and cover with a blanket.</li>
            <li>Have patient lie down, and handle gently (abrupt movement may cause arrhythmia).</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
            <li>Do not allow patient to walk or move about.</li>
            <li>Do not give anything to eat or drink.</li>
            <li>Do not allow patient to use stimulants such as caffeine or nicotine.</li>
            <li>Do not massage the skin or extremities.</li>
            <li>Do not immerse patient in hot water or use direct heat (hot water bottle, heat lamp, heating pad) because rapid warming can cause heart problems.</li>
            <li>In an unresponsive patient, assess pulse for 30-45 seconds before starting CPR. </li>
            <li>Use AED as usual, following local protocol.</li>
        </ol>
