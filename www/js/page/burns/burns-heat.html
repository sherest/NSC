        <h1>Emergency Care for Heat Burns</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Follow general principles of wound care.</li>
            <li>Stop the burning by removing heat source and any smoldering clothing. </li>
            <li>Cool the burn with running cool or cold potable water except for large, full-thickness burns.</li>
            <li> Remove constricting clothing and jewelry before the area swells. If clothing sticks to the burn, do not pull it from the burn but cut around it.</li>
            <li>Treat for shock: Have the patient lie down, elevate legs if no trauma and maintain a normal body temperature. </li>
            <li>Carefully cover the burn with a nonstick dressing or a sheet over a larger area. </li>
            <li>If patient may have inhaled smoke or fumes, watch for airway problems and provide airway and breathing support as needed.</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
            <li>Do not apply any cream or ointment on the burn and do not break blisters.</li>
            <li>Do not put ice on a burn.</li>
            <li>Do not give the patient anything to drink.</li>
            <li>Monitor the airway and breathing and be ready to give BLS if needed.</li>
            <li>With an infant or a child, a large burn may result in greater fluid and heat loss. Keep the environment warm when possible. With suspicious pattern of burn marks, consider the possibility of child abuse. </li>
