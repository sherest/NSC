        <h1>Emergency Care for Chemical Burns</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Send someone to get the SDS for the chemical.</li>
            <li>Wear gloves and eye protection.</li>
            <li>Move the patient from confined area or ventilate the area because of the risk of fumes.</li>
            <li>With a dry chemical, first brush it off the patient’s skin with a gloved hand or cloth. Avoid contaminating unexposed skin.</li>
            <li>Flush the area as quickly as possible with large amounts of running water. Continue flushing until additional EMS personnel arrive or until a toxic-specific solution is available. Do not try to neutralize an acid by applying an alkaline substance or vice versa.</li>
            <li>Remove clothing and jewelry from the burn area while flushing with water.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>For a chemical splash in the eye:</h1>
        <p>Flush the eye immediately with large amounts of clean running water for at least 15 minutes or until additional EMS personnel arrive. If tap water is not available, use normal saline or a commercial eye irrigation solution. Have the patient remove a contact lens. Tilt the patient’s head so that the water runs away from the face and not into the other eye. Follow local protocol to consult the Poison Control Center for additional treatment guidance.</p>
        <h1>Emergency Care for Electrical Burns</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Do not touch the patient until you know the area is safe. Unplug or turn off the power. Do not approach the scene of a downed power line.</li>
            <li>Care for the burn: Stop the burning, cool the area, remove clothing and jewelry, and cover the burn with a sterile dressing.</li>
            <li>Treat for shock by having the patient lie down, elevating the legs if spinal injury is not suspected, and maintaining normal body temperature.</li>
            <li>Keep an unresponsive patient in the recovery position and monitor breathing and vital signs. Be prepared to give BLS if needed.</li>
            <li>Assume a patient who experienced a lightning strike or high-voltage shock may have a spinal injury, and stabilize the head and neck.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Emergency Care for Heat Burns</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Follow general principles of wound care.</li>
            <li>Stop the burning by removing heat source and any smoldering clothing. </li>
            <li>Cool the burn with running cool or cold potable water except for large, full-thickness burns.</li>
            <li> Remove constricting clothing and jewelry before the area swells. If clothing sticks to the burn, do not pull it from the burn but cut around it.</li>
            <li>Treat for shock: Have the patient lie down, elevate legs if no trauma and maintain a normal body temperature. </li>
            <li>Carefully cover the burn with a nonstick dressing or a sheet over a larger area. </li>
            <li>If patient may have inhaled smoke or fumes, watch for airway problems and provide airway and breathing support as needed.</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
            <li>Do not apply any cream or ointment on the burn and do not break blisters.</li>
            <li>Do not put ice on a burn.</li>
            <li>Do not give the patient anything to drink.</li>
            <li>Monitor the airway and breathing and be ready to give BLS if needed.</li>
            <li>With an infant or a child, a large burn may result in greater fluid and heat loss. Keep the environment warm when possible. With suspicious pattern of burn marks, consider the possibility of child abuse. </li>
