        <h1>Emergency Care for Electrical Burns</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Do not touch the patient until you know the area is safe. Unplug or turn off the power. Do not approach the scene of a downed power line.</li>
            <li>Care for the burn: Stop the burning, cool the area, remove clothing and jewelry, and cover the burn with a sterile dressing.</li>
            <li>Treat for shock by having the patient lie down, elevating the legs if spinal injury is not suspected, and maintaining normal body temperature.</li>
            <li>Keep an unresponsive patient in the recovery position and monitor breathing and vital signs. Be prepared to give BLS if needed.</li>
            <li>Assume a patient who experienced a lightning strike or high-voltage shock may have a spinal injury, and stabilize the head and neck.</li>
