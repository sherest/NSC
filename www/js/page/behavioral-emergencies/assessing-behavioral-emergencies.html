                <li>Ask questions in a calm, reassuring voice.</li>
                <li>In cultures where it is acceptable, make good eye contact, and stay at the patient’s eye level.</li>
                <li>Without being judgmental, encourage the patient to tell what happened and what is troubling him or her.</li>

                <li>Do not belittle, threaten, challenge, or argue with disturbed patients.</li>
                <li>Do not “play along” with visual or auditory hallucinations, but do not challenge them.</li>
                <li>Involve trusted family members or friends in care activities.</li>
