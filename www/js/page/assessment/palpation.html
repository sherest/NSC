        <h1>Measuring Blood Pressure by Palpation</h1>
        <p>If you do not have a stethoscope or the scene is too noisy, measure systolic blood pressure by palpation.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>While palpating the radial pulse, inflate the cuff 30 mmHg beyond the point where you stop feeling the pulse.</li>
            <li>While watching the gauge, open the valve to slowly deflate the cuff.</li>
            <li>Note the pressure when you feel radial pulse return (systolic pressure). You cannot measure diastolic pressure by palpation.</li>
            <li>Record the pressure as systolic pressure and include the word palpated (e.g., “130 palpated” or “130/P”). </li>
        </ol>
