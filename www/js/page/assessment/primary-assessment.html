        <h1>Assess Responsiveness</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>State your name and say that you are an emergency medical responder here to help. Ask the patient what is wrong.</li>
            <li>If patient is not speaking, making other sounds, or moving, tap patient gently on shoulder and shout, “Are you OK?”</li>
            <li>Be careful not to move patient. Do not shake the shoulder or touch head or neck.</li>
            <li>Always suspect spinal injury in a trauma patient and take steps to stabilize patient’s head and neck.</li>
            <li>For unresponsive patient, immediately ensure EMS has been activated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Look for Normal Breathing While Checking for a Pulse (less than 10 seconds)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Reflex gasping (agonal respirations) just after cardiac arrest is not normal breathing.</li>
            <li>In a responsive adult or child, check the radial pulse.</li>
            <li>In an unresponsive adult or child, check the carotid pulse.</li>
            <li>In an infant, use the brachial pulse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Check for Serious Bleeding</h1>
