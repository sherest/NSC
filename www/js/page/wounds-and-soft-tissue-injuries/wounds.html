            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Consider whether wound care requires BSI precautions in addition
                to gloves. Use eye protection, gown, and other precautions as
                needed. Wash hands well after care.
            </li>
            <li>Control bleeding by covering the wound with sterile gauze and
                applying direct pressure.
            </li>
            <li>With minor wounds only, such as abrasions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Irrigate the wound with large amounts of warm or
                        room-temperature water with or without soap to flush out debris
                        and clean the area to prevent infection.
                    </li>
                    <li>Let clean tap water run over the wound until no foreign matter
                        is left in the wound.
                    </li>
                    <li>Never delay or interrupt efforts to stop bleeding to clean a
                        wound.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pat the area dry and apply a sterile dressing and bandage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prevent further contamination with a dressing and bandage.</li>
            <li>Even with a minor wound, if stitches may be needed or the
                patient does not have a current tetanus vaccination, ensure that
                the patient receives medical attention.
            </li>
            <li>Do not let the patient put alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine
                on the wound, which may damage tissue or cause an allergic
                reaction.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid breathing or blowing on the wound, which may transmit
                pathogens.
            </li>
            <li>Do not remove clothing stuck to a wound, but cut around it and
                leave it in place.
            </li>
            <li>Do not scrub a wound.</li>
