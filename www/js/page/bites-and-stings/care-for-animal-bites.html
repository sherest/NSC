    	<h1>Care for Animal Bites</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Follow general principles of wound care.</li>
            <li>Clean the wound with large amounts of warm or room-temperature water with or without soap (except when bleeding severely).</li>
            <li>Control bleeding.</li>
            <li>Cover wound with sterile dressing and bandage.</li>
            <li>Ensure patient sees health care provider as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>Do not try to catch any animal that may have rabies. Note its appearance and describe it to health care provider.</li>
            <li>All animal bites should be reported to local animal control officers or law enforcement personnel.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Care for Other Bites and Stings</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Perform standard patient care.</li>
            <li>Have patient lie down and stay calm. (Do not move patient unless absolutely necessary.)</li>
            <li>Wash bite wound with large amounts of warm or room-temperature water with or without soap.</li>
            <li>Remove jewelry or tight clothing before swelling begins.</li>
            <li>Do not put a tourniquet on patient. With snake bite, wrap extremity with compression bandage.</li>
            <li>Do not cut the wound open to try to drain or suck out venom.</li>
            <li>Remove a stinger and venom sac from skin by scraping it away gently with a piece of plastic like a credit card (not a knife blade).</li>
            <li>Observe for signs or symptoms of severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling in other areas, anxiety, nausea or vomiting), and treat for shock.</li>
            <li>If patient is allergic to bee or wasp stings and has an emergency epinephrine auto-injector, follow local protocol to assist with the medication. (See <a ui-sref="app.medication.autoInjectorSevereAllergicReaction">here</a>)</li>
            <li>Place unresponsive patient in recovery position, monitor breathing and vital signs, and give BLS as needed.</li>
        </ol>
