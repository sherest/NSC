        <h1>Use of a Tourniquet to Control Bleeding</h1>
        <p>With severe bleeding from an extremity that cannot otherwise be controlled, a tourniquet may be effective. A tourniquet may be also be appropriate if a pressure bandage does not control serious bleeding and you are unable to maintain manual pressure, such as when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are multiple patients to care for.</li>
            <li>The patient has multiple injuries requiring care.</li>
            <li>The environment is unsafe and you need to evacuate the patient.</li>
            <li>You are unable to access the wound.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use a commercial tourniquet if available, following the manufacturer’s steps for its correct use. Only apply a tourniquet if you are trained in their use. Following are steps for an improvised tourniquet:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To make a tourniquet, use a non-stretchy material, such as terry cloth or a triangular bandage), folded lengthwise to be 1-2 inches wide.</li>
            <li>Tie the tourniquet around the injured arm or leg, several inches above the injury. If the injury is below the elbow or knee, you may need to tie the tourniquet above the joint. Use a common square knot (like tying your shoes without the bow).</li>
            <li>Above the first knot in the tourniquet, position a stick or other long object as a windlass that can be twisted to tighten the tourniquet, and tie a second square knot. Use any long object that is strong enough to hold the tourniquet and can be secured in place (a pencil, stick, spoon, pipe, etc.).</li>
            <li>Twist the windlass to increase the pressure until the bleeding stops.</li>
            <li>Secure the windlass in place by tying one or both ends to the patient’s arm or leg.</li>
            <li>If possible, mark the time the tourniquet was placed by putting a “T” on the patient’s forehead with the time/day.</li>

        </ol>
