        <ol>
            <li>Support infant face down by holding head in one hand, with torso on your forearm against your thigh. Give up to 5 back blows (slaps) between shoulder blades with heel of your hand.</li>
            <li>Check for expelled object. If not present, continue with next step.</li>
            <li>With your other hand on back of infant’s head, roll infant face up, supporting the back of infant’s head with your hand.</li>
            <li>Give up to 5 chest thrusts with two fingers on sternum just below nipple line, about 1 per second. Each thrust should be 1½ inches deep. Check mouth for expelled object.</li>
            <li>Continue cycles of 5 back blows (slaps) and 5 chest thrusts, and checking the mouth. If alone, call 9-1-1 after 2 minutes. Continue until object is expelled or infant becomes unresponsive. If infant becomes unresponsive, give CPR. Look inside the mouth before giving breaths, after each cycle of compressions, and remove any object.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Airway Obstruction in Any Unresponsive Patient</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Give CPR – the chest compressions may expel the foreign object. </li>
            <li>Each time you open patient’s airway to give breaths, check first if the object is visible, and remove it if so.</li>
        </ol>
