        <h1>Foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Care depends on whether the patient is responsive or unresponsive and whether the obstruction is partial
                or complete.
            </li>
            <li>For a <b>responsive, choking patient who is coughing,</b> encourage the coughing to clear the object.
                Stay with the patient and call for additional EMS resources if the object is not immediately expelled.
            </li>
            <li>For a <b>responsive, choking patient who cannot speak or cough</b> forcefully, give abdominal thrusts.
            </li>
            <li>For an <b>unresponsive patient</b> with an FBAO, ensure additional EMS personnel have been summoned and
                begin CPR with 30 chest compressions. Each time you open the patient’s airway to give rescue breaths,
                look first for an object in the mouth. Remove any object you see with a finger sweep. Then give 2
                breaths. If breaths go in, check for a pulse. If breaths do not go in, continue CPR – look in mouth each
                time before providing breaths and remove any object seen.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Stand behind the patient with one leg forward between the patient’s legs. Keep your head slightly to one side. With a small child, kneel behind the child. Reach around the abdomen.</li>
            <li>Make a fist with 1 hand and place thumb side of your fist against patient’s abdomen just above the
                navel. Grasp fist with your other hand.</li>
            <li>Thrust inward and upward into patient’s abdomen with quick jerks. Continue abdominal thrusts until the patient expels the object or becomes unresponsive.</li>
            <li>For a responsive pregnant patient or any patient you cannot get your arms around, give chest thrusts in
                the middle of the breastbone from behind the patient. Take care not to squeeze the ribs with your arms.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Severe Foreign Body Airway Obstruction in a Responsive Infant</h1>

        </figure>
        <ol>
            <li>Support infant face down by holding head in one hand, with torso on your forearm against your thigh. Give up to 5 back blows (slaps) between shoulder blades with heel of your hand.</li>
            <li>Check for expelled object. If not present, continue with next step.</li>
            <li>With your other hand on back of infant’s head, roll infant face up, supporting the back of infant’s head with your hand.</li>
            <li>Give up to 5 chest thrusts with two fingers on sternum just below nipple line, about 1 per second. Each thrust should be 1½ inches deep. Check mouth for expelled object.</li>
            <li>Continue cycles of 5 back blows (slaps) and 5 chest thrusts, and checking the mouth. If alone, call 9-1-1 after 2 minutes. Continue until object is expelled or infant becomes unresponsive. If infant becomes unresponsive, give CPR. Look inside the mouth before giving breaths, after each cycle of compressions, and remove any object.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Airway Obstruction in Any Unresponsive Patient</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Give CPR – the chest compressions may expel the foreign object. </li>
            <li>Each time you open patient’s airway to give breaths, check first if the object is visible, and remove it if so.</li>
        </ol>
