            <li>Care depends on whether the patient is responsive or unresponsive and whether the obstruction is partial
                or complete.
            </li>
            <li>For a <b>responsive, choking patient who is coughing,</b> encourage the coughing to clear the object.
                Stay with the patient and call for additional EMS resources if the object is not immediately expelled.
            </li>
            <li>For a <b>responsive, choking patient who cannot speak or cough</b> forcefully, give abdominal thrusts.
            </li>
            <li>For an <b>unresponsive patient</b> with an FBAO, ensure additional EMS personnel have been summoned and
                begin CPR with 30 chest compressions. Each time you open the patient’s airway to give rescue breaths,
                look first for an object in the mouth. Remove any object you see with a finger sweep. Then give 2
                breaths. If breaths go in, check for a pulse. If breaths do not go in, continue CPR – look in mouth each
                time before providing breaths and remove any object seen.
