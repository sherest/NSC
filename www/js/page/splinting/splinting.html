        <p>Splint an injured extremity if there is risk for movement of the area unless help is
            expected within a few minutes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First put a dressing on open wounds.</li>
            <li>Assess circulation, sensation, and movement (CSM) before splinting.</li>
            <li>Splint an injury only if it does not cause more pain. Otherwise, manually
                immobilize.
            </li>
            <li>Splint an injury in the position you find it. Straighten an extremity only if the
                patient will not receive medical attention for a long time and if circulation has
                been cut off in extremity by the injury. Follow local protocol.
            </li>
            <li>Splint to immobilize the entire injured area from joints above and below the injured
                area.
            </li>
            <li>Use padding that conforms to the space between the splint and the body part.</li>
            <li>Put splints on both sides of a extremity fracture, if possible.</li>
            <li>Do not secure the splint on an open wound.</li>
            <li>Elevate a splinted extremity if possible, but not if it causes pain or may worsen
                the injury.
            </li>
            <li>Apply a cold pack to the injury around the splint; remove after 20 minutes (or 10
                minutes if it produces discomfort).
            </li>
            <li>Do not completely bandage over fingers or toes, and assess them for CSM frequently
                after splinting. Swelling, pale or bluish discoloration, tingling or numbness, and
                cold skin are signs and symptoms of reduced circulation. If any occur, loosen the
                splint.
            </li>
        </ul>
