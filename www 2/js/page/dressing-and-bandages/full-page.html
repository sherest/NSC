        <h1>Applying Dressings</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Wash hands and put on gloves.</li>
            <li>Choose a dressing larger than the wound. Do not touch the dressing where it will contact the wound.</li>
            <li>Carefully lay (not slide) the dressing on the wound.</li>
            <li>If blood seeps through, do not remove dressing but add more dressings on top of it.</li>
            <li>Follow local protocol for use of hemostatic dressings.</li>
            <li>Apply direct pressure as needed to control bleeding. Apply a bandage to hold the dressing in place and
                maintain pressure.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Guidelines for Bandaging</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Bandages do not directly touch the wound, and should be clean but not necessarily sterile.</li>
            <li>To put pressure on a wound to stop bleeding or to prevent swelling of an injury, apply the bandage
                firmly â€“ but do not cut off circulation. The pressure is sufficient if the bandage is snug but you can
                slip a finger under it.
            </li>
            <li>Never encircle the neck with a bandage.</li>
            <li>Do not cover fingers or toes unless injured.</li>
            <li>With a bandage around a limb, check fingers or toes for color, warmth, and sensation (normal touch, not
                tingling) to ensure circulation is not cut off.
            </li>
            <li>If signs of reduced circulation, unwrap the bandage and reapply it less tightly.</li>
            <li>Because swelling may continue, keep checking tightness of bandage to prevent cutting off circulation.
            </li>
            <li>Be sure bandage is secure enough that dressing will not move and expose the wound.</li>
            <li>With elastic and roller bandages, anchor first end and tie, tape, pin, or clip the ending section in
                place.
            </li>
            <li>Use an elastic bandage to make a pressure bandage around a limb to control bleeding and protect the
                wound.
            </li>
            <li>Use an elastic bandage to support a joint and prevent swelling.</li>
            <li>Wrap a bandage from the bottom of the limb upward to help prevent cutting off circulation.</li>
            <li>Bandage joint in the position where it will stay.</li>
            <li>Use a wide bandage with evenly distributed pressure around the extremity.</li>
        </ul>
