        <h1>Assessment</h1>
        <h1>Primary Assessment</h1>
        <h1>Assess Responsiveness</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>State your name and say that you are an emergency medical responder here to help. Ask the patient what is wrong.</li>
            <li>If patient is not speaking, making other sounds, or moving, tap patient gently on shoulder and shout, "Are you OK?"</li>
            <li>Be careful not to move patient. Do not shake the shoulder or touch head or neck.</li>
            <li>Always suspect spinal injury in a trauma patient and take steps to stabilize patient's head and neck.</li>
            <li>For unresponsive patient, immediately ensure EMS has been activated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Look for Normal Breathing While Checking for a Pulse (less than 10 seconds)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Reflex gasping (agonal respirations) just after cardiac arrest is not normal breathing.</li>
            <li>In a responsive adult or child, check the radial pulse.</li>
            <li>In an unresponsive adult or child, check the carotid pulse.</li>
            <li>In an infant, use the brachial pulse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Check for Serious Bleeding</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Control serious bleeding immediately with direct pressure.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h1>Secondary Assessment</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>SAMPLE history</li>
            <li>Vital signs</li>
            <li>Physical examination</li>
            <li>Reassessment</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>SAMPLE History</h1>

        <dl>
            <dt>S</dt>
            <dd>Signs and symptoms. What can you observe about the patient (signs)? Ask how he or she feels (symptoms) and to describe any pain felt. Ask why EMS was called.</dd>
            <dt>A</dt>
            <dd>Allergies. Ask the patient about any allergies to foods, medicines, insect stings, anything in the environment or other substances. Look for a medical alert ID.</dd>
            <dt>M</dt>
            <dd>Medications. Ask if patient is currently taking or recently has taken any prescribed medications or over-the-counter products, including vitamins, supplements and herbal remedies.</dd>
            <dt>P</dt>
            <dd>Pertinent past medical history. Ask if patient has experienced anything like this before, is seeing a health care provider for any illnesses or has ever been in the hospital. Check for a medical alert ID.</dd>
            <dt>L</dt>
            <dd>Last food or drink. Ask what the patient last ate or drank, and when and how much.</dd>
            <dt>E</dt>
            <dd>Events. Ask what happened and when, and try to identify events leading to the current situation.</dd>

 <h1>Measuring Blood Pressure by Auscultation</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Position the cuff on the patient's arm.</li>
            <li>Position the stethoscope diaphragm and inflate the cuff 30 mmHg beyond where the tapping sound disappears.</li>
            <li>Watching the gauge, slowly deflate cuff at 2-3 mmHg per second.</li>
            <li>Note the pressure when the pulse tapping sound returns (systolic pressure).</li>
            <li>As the cuff deflates, note the reading when the tapping sound disappears (diastolic pressure).</li>
            <li>Deflate the cuff and record the pressure (systolic/diastolic).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h1>Measuring Blood Pressure by Palpation</h1>
        <p>If you do not have a stethoscope or the scene is too noisy, measure systolic blood pressure by palpation.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>While palpating the radial pulse, inflate the cuff 30 mmHg beyond the point where you stop feeling the pulse.</li>
            <li>While watching the gauge, open the valve to slowly deflate the cuff.</li>
            <li>Note the pressure when you feel radial pulse return (systolic pressure). You cannot measure diastolic pressure by palpation.</li>
            <li>Record the pressure as systolic pressure and include the word palpated (e.g., "130 palpated" or "130/P"). </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Physical Examination</h1>
        <h1>Check each area for DOTS/ DCAP-BTLS</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Palpate and inspect the scalp and face.</li>
            <li>Check for eye injuries and assess the pupils.</li>
            <li>Check ears and nose for bleeding or leaking fluid.</li>
            <li>Check mouth for injury, bleeding, and potential airway obstructions.</li>
            <li>Remove upper body clothing and palpate and inspect the neck in front and back.</li>
            <li>Palpate and inspect the chest, and observe movement with breathing.</li>
            <li>Palpate and inspect abdominal quadrants.</li>
            <li>Reach under patient to palpate the back and check for bleeding.</li>
            <li>Remove lower clothing and palpate pelvis.</li>
            <li>Palpate and inspect each upper and lower leg.</li>
            <li>Check the pulse in each foot.</li>
            <li>Check each foot for movement and sensation.</li>
            <li>Palpate and inspect upper extremities from clavicle to shoulder and down the arm.</li>
            <li>Check radial pulse in each arm.</li>
            <li>Check hands for movement and sensation.</li>

        <h1>Reassessment</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue to assess the patient while awaiting additional EMS resources and giving care.</li>
            <li>Calm and reassure the patient while reassessing breathing and circulation and repeating the vital signs and physical examination as needed. </li>
            <li>Repeat reassessments as indicated by the patientâ€™s condition or:
                <ul>
                    <li>Every 15 minutes for a stable patient</li>
                    <li>Every 5 minutes for an unstable patient</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <h1>Compare reassessments results to first assessments (baseline status): </h1>

            <li>Level of responsiveness</li>
            <li>Airway maintenance</li>
            <li>Adequacy of breathing (rate, depth, effort)</li>
            <li>Adequacy of circulation (carotid or radial pulse; skin color, temperature, and moisture)</li>
