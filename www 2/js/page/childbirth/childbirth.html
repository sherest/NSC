        <h1>Childbirth</h1>
        <h1>Supportive Care During Labor</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure a plan is in place for the woman’s transport to planned childbirth location or the arrival of a planned attendant.</li>
            <li>Help the woman rest in whatever position is most comfortable.</li>
            <li>Provide desired comfort measures, such as massaging the lower back (may help reduce pain). The woman should not eat or drink but may suck on ice chips or moisten lips.</li>
            <li>Do not let the woman bathe if the amniotic sac has ruptured.</li>
            <li>Time the length and interval of contractions, and write this down.</li>
            <li>Remind the woman to control her breathing: short, quick breaths (panting) during contractions, and deep, slow breaths between.</li>
            <li>Help calm and reassure the woman. (Anxiety and fear add to pain.) Regular deep breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth may help her relax. (Use the same technique yourself, in sync with the woman.)</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Assessing Childbirth Imminence</h1>
        <ol>
            <liAsk whether the “bloody show” has occurred.</li>
            <li>When did contractions begin? How close together are they and how long does each last? (Time from beginning of one to beginning of the next.) If less than 5 minutes apart and each lasts 45-60 seconds, delivery may occur soon – make preparations. When contractions are about 2 minutes apart, delivery will likely occur soon.</li>
            <li>Ask whether the woman feels a strong urge to push or feels like she is having a bowel movement– may mean imminent delivery.</li>
            <li>If other signs are suggestive, check for infant’s head crowning. If possible, ask a woman to look. If so, be prepared for delivery very soon – <em>not</em> preparing the woman for transport.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Prepare for Childbirth</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Provide privacy for the mother.</li>
            <li>Prepare birthing bed with clean sheets over a rubber or plastic sheet (or shower curtain or newspapers) to protect the mattress.</li>
            <li>If a bed is not present, prepare a clean place on the floor or ground with a padded area of newspapers, clothes, or blankets.</li>
            <li>Roll up your sleeves, wash your hands thoroughly for about 1 minute and put on medical exam gloves.</li>
            <li>If possible, protect your eyes, mouth and nose from likely splashes of blood and fluids.</li>
            <li>Do not let the woman go to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Do not touch vaginal areas except during delivery and when a partner is present.</li>
            <li>Call dispatch or the woman’s health care provider for additional instructions.</li>
            <li>Do not make any internal vaginal examination. When crowning occurs, move woman into birthing position and assist with delivery.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Assisting with Delivery</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Help the woman to lie on her back with hips elevated and knees bent and apart and feet flat on the bed.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If she feels faint or dizzy, use pillows or blankets under her right side to position her slightly on her left side.</li>
                <li>She may have been trained already in other acceptable birthing positions.</li>
                <li>Ensure that she is not wearing undergarments or clothing that could get in the way.</li>
                <li>If she prefers, cover her above the knees with a blanket or sheet.</li>
                <li>Place folded towels or blanket under her buttocks.</li>
                <li>Do not try to delay the birth by having her hold her legs together or any other maneuver.</li>
                <li>Talk to her and tell her what is happening throughout.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>As the infant’s head appears, have your gloved hands ready to receive and support the head, which may emerge very quickly.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not interfere with the birth or touch the infant until the head is completely out.</li>
                    <li>Check that the head is not covered by the amniotic sac; if so, pull it away as mouth and nose emerge.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>As head emerges (usually face down), support the head.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If umbilical cord is wrapped around the infant’s neck, carefully slip it over the head or shoulder to prevent strangulation. Avoid putting pressure on the cord or pulling it.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>After the head is out, have woman stop pushing and breathe in a panting manner.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If there is a delay before the shoulders emerge, suction the newborn’s mouth and nose.</li>
                    <li>Support the infant as body emerges, often quickly after the head.</li>
                    <li>Do not pull on the head or shoulders.</li>
                    <li>Usually the infant turns to side as the shoulder emerges.</li>
                    <li>Newborns are usually very slippery and should be handled carefully. Grasp the infant’s feet as they emerge.</li>
                    <li>Note the time of birth.</li>
                    <li>If mother is having multiple births, prepare for delivery of second infant. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Position the newborn on its side, at level of the vagina, with head lower than feet for secretions to drain from the nose and mouth.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a bulb syringe to gently suction secretions from the mouth first and then the nose, or wipe both with sterile gauze.</li>
                    <li>If you don’t have a bulb syringe, gently stroke downward on the baby's nose to help expel excess mucus and amniotic fluid.</li>
                    <li>The newborn normally begins to cry. If not, gently flick bottom of feet with a finger or gently rub its back.</li>
                    <li>If newborn is still not crying, check for breathing and give ventilations if needed.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Gently dry and wrap the infant in a towel or blanket to prevent heat loss, keeping the cord loose and free of compression and kinks.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not wash infant’s skin, eyes  or ears.</li>
                    <li>Place the infant it on the mother’s abdomen, on its side with the head low for nose and mouth to drain.  If you cannot place the newborn here for any reason, keep it warm and above the level of the mother’s heart.</li>
                    <li>Only if the infant must be separated from the mother in order to provide emergency care should the cord be cut.</li>
                    <li>Ensure infant stays warm and continues to breathe.</li>
                    <li>The mother can begin nursing the infant immediately (helps uterus contract and stop bleeding).</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Follow local protocol to clamp or tie the umbilical cord or leave it intact for arriving EMS personnel.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is often not necessary to tie or cut the umbilical cord, even after placenta has been delivered, when medical help will arrive soon.   If help may be delayed, clamp or tie and cut the cord before delivery of placenta.</li>
                    <li>Wait until cord stops pulsating, and clamp or tie a tight knot around the cord about 10 inches from the infant, using strips of gauze, string, or thin strips of cloth.</li>
                    <li>Clamp or tie a second knot about 7 inches from the infant, and cut the cord between the two ties with sterilized scissors or a sterile scalpel. </li>
                </ul>

            <li>Wait for delivery of placenta and umbilical cord, usually with milder contractions in 10-30 minutes. Do not pull on the umbilical cord to pull out the placenta.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blood often gushes out as the placenta detaches from the uterus.</li>
                    <li>Keep placenta at level of infant while waiting for EMS personnel. Save the placenta in a plastic bag or towel for health care providers to examine.</li>
                    <li>Place a sanitary pad over vaginal opening to help control bleeding, and lower the woman’s legs together.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Continue to monitor both mother and newborn.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Care for Maternal Bleeding After Delivery</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>To stimulate the uterus to contract and reduce bleeding, massage the mother’s abdomen below the navel, where you feel the uterus as a mass about the size of a softball.</li>
            <li>Explain to the mother that this helps stop the bleeding.</li>
            <li>Gently massage with your palms, using a kneading motion in a continuous circular motion.</li>
            <li>If bleeding persists:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Be sure you are kneading, not rubbing, with your palms.</li>
                <li>Keep the mother still and calm while waiting for additional EMS resources.</li>
                <li>Treat her for shock.</li>
                <li>Follow local protocol to administer oxygen if available and you are trained.</li>
                <li>Encourage breastfeeding, which stimulates contraction of the uterus.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h1>Care of the Newborn</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Assess the newborn:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note skin color, movement, and whether crying is strong or weak.</li>
                    <li>Normal respiratory rate for newborns is >40 breaths/minute.</li>
                    <li>Normal pulse for newborns is >100 beats/minute (taken at umbilical cord or brachial artery).</li>
                    <li>Note any changes over time for arriving EMS personnel.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(See also <a ui-sref="page.apgar">APGAR Score for Newborn Assessment</a>)</p>
            <li>Dry but do not wash the newborn, whose skin may be covered with vernix.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the infant stays wrapped, including the head, to stay warm.</li>
            <li>Support the newborn’s head if it must be moved for any reason.</li>
            <li>Continue to check the breathing and airway.</li>
        </ol>
